✅ Key differences from your first test file:

Direct controller testing — no HTTP server is spun up. This tests controller logic in isolation.

Each test uses its own in-memory database (Guid.NewGuid()) to avoid test interference.

No HttpClient — you call controller methods directly.

Tests focus on CRUD operations and result types, not the full HTTP pipeline.


| Aspect               | Approach 1: `CustomWebApplicationFactory` / `HttpClient`                                                      | Approach 2: Direct Controller Testing (`ReadingsControllerTests`)                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Testing level**    | Integration testing (tests the app as a whole, including middleware, routing, filters, etc.)                  | Unit/controller testing (isolated testing of controller logic)                     |
| **HTTP pipeline**    | Full HTTP pipeline is exercised via `HttpClient`                                                              | No HTTP pipeline; methods are called directly                                      |
| **Database**         | Typically uses in-memory DB (or test DB) via full app configuration                                           | In-memory DB per test (`Guid.NewGuid()` ensures isolation)                         |
| **Setup complexity** | More complex: requires `CustomWebApplicationFactory` and optionally overriding services                       | Simple: just create DbContext and controller instance                              |
| **Performance**      | Slower due to full pipeline and DI container setup                                                            | Faster because it only runs controller logic                                       |
| **Use cases**        | Best for testing end-to-end behavior, middleware, routing, filters, authentication, and actual HTTP responses | Best for testing controller logic, CRUD methods, validation, and return types      |
| **Assertions**       | Usually assert on HTTP response (status code, content, headers)                                               | Assert on returned objects and result types (OkObjectResult, NotFoundResult, etc.) |
| **Isolation**        | Less isolated; may need careful configuration to avoid conflicts with other services                          | Fully isolated: each test has its own controller and DB                            |
| **Example**          | `var response = await _client.GetAsync("/readings");`                                                         | `var result = await controller.GetAll();`                                          |

### ✅ Summary:

* **Use `CustomWebApplicationFactory`** when you want **integration-level confidence** that the app works end-to-end.
* **Use direct controller tests** for **fast, isolated unit tests** of controller logic without involving the full HTTP pipeline.

Think of it like this:

* Integration tests = **driving the car on the road**.
* Controller unit tests = **checking each part of the engine separately**.
